    "QUEBEC — The Legault government will study the finances of Montreal’s Olympic Park in January, and it won’t be until then that the cost of any new roof for the stadium will be revealed, Quebec Tourism Minister Caroline Proulx told reporters on Wednesday.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arriving at the weekly cabinet meeting, Proulx refused to confirm a report in La Presse that said Quebec taxpayers would have to foot a bill of at least $750 million to replace the Olympic Stadium roof.\n",

    "“We can study it sometime in January, then we’ll get back to you with the cost, the schedules and all that involves a potential replacement of the roof,” Proulx said. “The cabinet will make its decision in January.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Last October, Premier François Legault stated clearly that the Olympic Stadium needed a new roof and the venue needed a new lease on life, even though the operation might be costly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The current roof has reached the end of its operational life. In 2017, the Liberal government of Philippe Couillard announced the roof would be replaced at a cost of $200 million to $250 million with delivery of the project expected in 2022. But in 2019, that timetable was pushed to 2024 because of the complexity of the project. Since then, the amended schedule has also been scrapped, and no new date has been provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "On Wednesday, Proulx told reporters the stadium roof was torn in about 20,000 places, but she had no intention of “presuming” what cabinet would do.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Doing roof work is never really the ‘sexiest’ thing,” she said. “(But) if we wait any longer, within a year or two, the Olympic Stadium will be completely closed.”\n",

    "“McGill is a jewel in Quebec’s crown — one of the world’s leading universities and consistently the best in Canada,” she said. “Instead of celebrating it and urging it on to greater success, the Legault government wants to punish it — all in the name of protecting and promoting the French language against what it perceives to be a threat in downtown Montreal.”\n",
